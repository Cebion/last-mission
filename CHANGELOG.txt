
Project history:

v0.5, 2 August 2011
	+  rewrite a bit keypress routines 
	+  any key to exit demo mode
	+  make elevators part of the game process, not a cutscene - make final cleanup
	+  pause mode
	+  fullscreen toggle for sdl (win32 and *nix)
	+  rotating "the last mission" logo
	+  showing big title picture
v0.6, 18 March 2012
	+  total recoloring, MSX2 version is taken as an example
	+  certain floors, ceilings and electric wires kill the flying turet again,
	    now the game is as hardcore as original
	+  intro music remix of the original theme
	+  proper support for Ritmix RZX-50 (turn OFF A320 compatibility mode) and Dingoo A380/A320e (not tested)
	   the game probes sequentially 480x272, 400x240 and 320x240 resolutions and chooses whatever available  
	+  fullscreen bilinear or bresenham upscaling from 320x200 to 480x272 or 400x240 (left shoulder turns it on/off)
	+  frameskip 0/1 (right shoulder)
v0.?, TO DO:
	-  make textured backgrounds
	-  make 10 backgrounds
	-  incorporate joystick code
	-  more sound effects	
	-  recolor intro screen and rotating logo
	? optimize upscaling in mips asm?
	? pixel-perfect collision
